# Movie API

## Project Description
This project was created to deepen my understanding of Java backend development by implementing a RESTful service. It allows users to perform basic CRUD operations such as adding, deleting, updating, and retrieving movies. Additionally, it includes features such as file handling for movie image uploads, JWT-based security, and exception handling. Pagination and sorting capabilities are also implemented to enhance data retrieval efficiency.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, update, delete, and retrieve movies.
- **File Handling**: Upload images related to movies.
- **Security**: JWT (JSON Web Token) implemented as a security layer.
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions for better error management.
- **Pagination & Sorting**: Easily navigate through large datasets.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**
- **PostgreSQL** (for database)

## Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_folder>


## Configure Application Properties:

## Test the API:
- Use Postman or any other API client to interact with the backend.
